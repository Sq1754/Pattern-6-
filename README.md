# Number Pyramid

This Java program generates a number pyramid pattern based on the user input of the number of rows.

## Description

The program prompts the user to input the number of rows for the pyramid. It then generates a number pyramid pattern where each row contains the same number repeated a specific number of times, corresponding to the row number.

## Pattern Example

For example, if the user inputs 5 as the number of rows, the program will generate the following pattern:

```

    1 
   2 2 
  3 3 3
 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

```
